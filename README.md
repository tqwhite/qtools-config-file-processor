# qTools Config File Processor

__CONVERTS .INI FILES TO JS OBJECTS WITH SANE DATA TYPES__

Opens a .ini file and places it’s contents into a Javascript object
_after_ converting values as best it can. It also adds information about
the .ini file.

That is, true become a boolean, not a string. 1 becomes a number, not a
string.

All numbered sections and subsections are converted to arrays.

Eg,

    someListItem.0=zero
    someListItem.1=one

will be presented as

    [‘zero’, one’]

Instead of the default,

    {‘0’:’zero’, ‘1’:’one’}
    
__SUBSTITUTES CERTAIN VALUES INTO STRINGS__

Two special values are subsituted __as strings__ into a JSON version of the
config using .qtTemplateReplace() tags.

<!userHomeDir!> will be replaced with the users home directory ($HOME, via, os.homedir()).

<!configDir!> is replaced with the parent directory of the configuration file being processed

For more details about substitutions, see _substitutions below.

__OPTIONAL: ASSEMBLING A CONFIGURATION INCLUDING OTHER FILES__

**TWO optional special sections ``[_mergeBefore]`` and ``[_mergeAfter]``** can contain a series of file paths to be merged
into the main configuration object. The file path can either be fully qualified or 
a path *relative* to the directory containing the main configuration.

_mergeAfter files contains properties that overwrite any existing values in the main config
including those from _mergeBefore and _includes.

_mergeBefore files are merged into a JSON object in the order presented. That is later files
overwrite values already present. These values are, in turn, overwritten by values from any
_includes files then the main configuration and finally any _mergeAfter files (in order).

*DEPRECATED* Another optional special section ``[_includes]`` can contain a series of file paths to be merged
into the main configuration object. The file path can either be fully qualified or 
a path relative to the directory containing the main configuration.



**A special .ini section, ``[_substitutions]``, can be added**, substitutions,
whose elements are substituted __as strings__ into a JSON version of the
config using .qtTemplateReplace() tags, eg, <!substitutionTag!>. The
_substitutions section is left in the config. Only use values that
convert to strings in ways that work for your application. (File path
segments are a really good use.)
    
The _substitutions section is applied by converting the configuration object JSON (after 
_mergeBefore, _includes and _mergeAfter are applied) and then replacing the substitution
tags with values from the _substitutions section.


Eg,
	
	[testSection]
    <!prefix!>_Name=<!someValue!>
    
    [_substitutions]
    prefix=HELLO
    someValue=This is a test!

will be presented as

    console.log(testSection.HELLO_Name); //=> 'This is a test'


__OPTIONAL: CONFIG LOCATION SEARCH__

**getConfig() also takes a optional second parameter**, workingDirectory. 
In this case, the first parameter is the name of a configuration file 
that is sought in the directory tree starting with the specified directory 
and working up.

**getConfig() can take a third parameter**, options, with these properties:

**`resolve`**	when set to true, the program logs the file paths tried in locating a configuration file.



__OPTIONAL: RUNTIME CONFIGURATION MODIFICATIONS__

**`injectedItems`** This object is added (*not* merged) to the configuration as a new property, 'injectedItems'.

**`userSubstitutions`**	These are applied in the same way as _substitutions elements in the .ini 
file. These are applied to the stringified version of the fully merged object *before* the
substitutions in the file. Consequently, they can be used to replace replacement tags in
the _substitution section of the main config. Eg, 

`configFileContentsString.replace('<!remoteBasePath!>', '<!prodRemoteBasePath!>')`.

By the time _substitutions is processed, all references to remoteBasePath have been changed
to prodRemoteBasePath and that is substituted into the final JS config object.

_I use it like this:_

>		if (options.useProdPath) {
>			configOptions = {
>				userSubstitutions: {
>					remoteBasePath: '<!prodRemoteBasePath!>'
>				}
>			};
>		}




__DEBUGGING HELP IS PLACED IN THE__ _meta __PROPERTY__

**A section named _meta is injected** into the config that identifies the 
source file and change date (see below) and other stuff that helps debug problems.

For example…

    
    const configFileProcessorGen=require('qtools-config-file-processor');
    const configFileProcessor=new configFileProcessorGen();
    
    const config=configFileProcessor.getConfig('/Path/to/test.ini')
    
    console.dir({"config [test.js.]":config});
    

Produces…
